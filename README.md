# EASY WORLD SAVE DOCUMENT
 > ### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: 
> There can be a lot of things in your world that need to be saved. Attach structures, material changes, meshes, properties, runtime-generated objects, dozens of interconnected components… Since all of these are constantly changing in the scene, deciding what to save and how to save it can become quite challenging. Wrong references, missing data, or actors loading back > in the wrong position are just some of the common problems.
> If you’re working with Blueprints, things can get even more complicated. Node graphs get larger, performance drops, and you end up having to save everything manually. In the end, building a solid save system takes far more time than expected in most projects.
> This plugin was created specifically to solve these issues. It automatically saves and loads complex world structures, objects, and their relationships for you. However, there is one important thing to remember: simply enabling the plugin is not enough. A small integration step is required. But aside from that, most of the work is already handled for you.
